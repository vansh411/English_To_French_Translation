        "- English input: The Wanderer\n",
        "- Model output: Le vagabond\n",
        "- Reference French: Le grand Meaulnes\n",
        "Reflection:\n",
        "- The translation makes sense but differs from the reference (synonym vs. proper noun).\n",
        "- Meaning is partially preserved, though the model simplified the title.\n",
        "- Grammar and word order are correct, but nuance is lost.\n",
        "Another example:\n",
        "- English input: The result was like lightning.\n",
        "- Model output: Le résultat était comme la foudre.\n",
        "- Reference French: Ce fut un éclair.\n",
        "Reflection:\n",
        "- The model output is grammatically correct and preserves meaning.\n",
        "- Word choice is more literal than the reference, showing the model’s tendency toward direct translation.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "The BLEU score provides a numeric benchmark, while qualitative inspection shows that the model produces understandable French sentences, generally preserving meaning and grammar, though sometimes missing idiomatic or stylistic nuances.\n"
